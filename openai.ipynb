       "\"**Langfuse** is an open-source **observability and analytics platform** designed for **LLM (Large Language Model) applications**. It helps developers and teams track, analyze, and optimize interactions with AI models like OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, or custom LLMs.\\n\\n### **Key Features of Langfuse:**\\n1. **Tracing & Logging**  \\n   - Records detailed traces of LLM calls (inputs, outputs, latency, tokens, costs).  \\n   - Supports nested tracing for complex workflows (e.g., multi-step AI agents).  \\n\\n2. **Analytics & Dashboards**  \\n   - Visualizes usage metrics (e.g., response times, token consumption, costs).  \\n   - Tracks user feedback (thumbs up/down) and custom metrics.  \\n\\n3. **Prompt Management & Versioning**  \\n   - Stores and versions prompts to compare performance across changes.  \\n   - A/B tests different prompts or model configurations.  \\n\\n4. **Quality Monitoring**  \\n   - Detects anomalies (e.g., unexpected outputs, high latency).  \\n   - Integrates with evaluation frameworks (e.g., LangSmith, custom evals).  \\n\\n5. **Open Source & Self-Hostable**  \\n   - Free to use with a **MIT license**.  \\n   - Can be deployed on your infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes).  \\n   - Also offers a managed cloud version.  \\n\\n### **Use Cases:**\\n- Debugging LLM applications in development.  \\n- Monitoring production AI deployments.  \\n- Optimizing costs and performance of LLM calls.  \\n\\n### **Integrations:**\\nWorks with **LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, Anthropic, and custom LLMs**. SDKs are available for **Python & JS/TS**.  \\n\\n🔗 **Website**: [langfuse.com](https://langfuse.com)  \\n📂 **GitHub**: [github.com/langfuse/langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)  \\n\\nWould you like help setting it up or exploring specific features?\""
